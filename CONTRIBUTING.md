## Branch Workflow

The [**develop**](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release/tree/develop) branch is where we do active development. Although we endeavor to keep the [**develop**](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release/tree/develop) branch stable, we do not guarantee that any given commit will deploy cleanly.

The [**release-candidate**](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release/tree/release-candidate) branch has passed all of our unit, integration, smoke, & acceptance tests, but has not been used in a final release yet. This branch should be fairly stable.

The [**master**](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release/tree/master) branch points to the most recent stable final release.

At semi-regular intervals a final release is created from the [**release-candidate**](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release/tree/release-candidate) branch. This final release is tagged and pushed to the [**master**](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release/tree/master) branch.

Pushing to any branch other than [**develop**](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release/tree/develop) will create problems for the CI pipeline, which relies on fast forward merges. To recover from this condition follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/blob/master/docs/fix_commit_to_master.md).
