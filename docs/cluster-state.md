# Determining Cluster State

Connect to each MySQL node using a mysql client and check its status.

<pre class="terminal">
$ mysql -u root -pPASSWORD -e 'show status like "wsrep_cluster_status";'
+----------------------+---------+
| Variable_name        | Value   |
+----------------------+---------+
| wsrep_cluster_status | Primary |
+----------------------+---------+
</pre>

If all nodes are in the `Primary` component, you have a healthy cluster. If some nodes are in a `Non-primary` component, those nodes are not able to join the cluster.

See how many nodes are in the cluster. 

<pre class="terminal">
$ mysql -u root -pPASSWORD -e 'show status like "wsrep_cluster_size";'
+--------------------+-------+
| Variable_name      | Value |
+--------------------+-------+
| wsrep_cluster_size | 3     |
+--------------------+-------+
</pre>

If the value of `wsrep_cluster_size` is equal to the expected number of nodes, then all nodes have joined the cluster. Otherwise, check network connectivity between nodes and use `monit status` to identify any issues preventing nodes from starting.
