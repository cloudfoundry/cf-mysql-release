## 1.0.0-beta (4/14/2014)
Breaking changes:

- `thirdparty/gomocktestreporter` is gone.  Use `GinkgoT()` instead
- Modified the Reporter interface 
- `watch` is now a subcommand, not a flag.

DSL changes:

- `BeforeSuite` and `AfterSuite` for setting up and tearing down test suites.
- `AfterSuite` is triggered on interrupt (`^C`) as well as exit.
- `SynchronizedBeforeSuite` and `SynchronizedAfterSuite` for setting up and tearing down singleton resources across parallel nodes.

CLI changes:

- `watch` is now a subcommand, not a flag
- `--nodot` flag can be passed to `ginkgo generate` and `ginkgo bootstrap` to avoid dot imports.  This explicitly imports all exported identifiers in Ginkgo and Gomega.  Refreshing this list can be done by running `ginkgo nodot`
- Additional arguments can be passed to specs.  Pass them after the `--` separator
- `--skipPackage` flag takes a regexp and ignores any packages with package names passing said regexp.
- `--trace` flag prints out full stack traces when errors occur, not just the line at which the error occurs.

Misc:

- Start using semantic versioning
- Start maintaining changelog

Major refactor:

- Pull out Ginkgo's internal to `internal`
- Rename `example` everywhere to `spec`
- Much more!
